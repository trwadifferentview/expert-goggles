Welcome To Suicidal Flea Circus, where I am attempt to do more than just dabble in digital photography and web design by means of patience & stubborn determination to
see if I can do more than I thought I could, or at least try and learn to! Any and all help, advie, and gentle guidance and patience with me will be incredibly appreciated I learn best by hands on and goofing around as I have lots of time to.
